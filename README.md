## File Explainations
file                    | description
----------------------- | -------------------------------
.gitignore              | Files that Git will not consider to add to the stage
README.md               | The file which you are meant to read before starting off. GitHub automatically displays README.md
file.html               | A file to be read by `webserver.js`
package.json            | A list of dependencies used by `npm`, the Node Package Manager. This is installed while you install Node.js
webserver.js            | The JavaScript file containing the code to run the server software
yarn.lock               | Ignore this file. A working file for `yarn`, an alternative package manager. This file tells yarn in what order the packages were installed so that a different computer can install packages in the same order, so there are no differences.
